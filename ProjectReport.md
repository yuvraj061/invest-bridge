# Project Report â€“ InvestBridge

---

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

In India, there is a significant communication gap between entrepreneurs seeking funding and investors looking for promising business opportunities. Traditional investment channels are often slow, opaque, and inaccessible to many. Bankers, who could facilitate or advise on such connections, are rarely part of a unified platform. InvestBridge aims to bridge this gap by providing a secure, user-friendly web platform that connects entrepreneurs, investors, and bankers, enabling direct communication, proposal sharing, and connection management.

The platform has evolved significantly to include advanced features like project evaluation, business advisory services, and a comprehensive Q&A system, making it a complete business networking and evaluation platform.

## 2. Objectives
- Enable secure registration and login for entrepreneurs, investors, bankers, and business advisors
- Allow users to post business proposals, investment criteria, and loan/advisory offers
- Facilitate browsing and discovery of opportunities with enhanced categorization
- Support connection requests and approval workflows
- Provide comprehensive project evaluation and risk assessment tools
- Offer business advisory services with consultation booking
- Create a community-driven Q&A and knowledge base system
- Ensure a modern, responsive, and easy-to-use interface with modular architecture

## 3. System Design & Architecture

The system is built as a single-page web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Firebase Authentication and Firestore as the backend. The architecture has been completely modularized, separating concerns into dedicated modules for authentication, post management, connection management, project evaluation, business advisory, query management, logging, and UI.

**Enhanced System Architecture:**
- **Modular Design**: Separated into 9 distinct modules for maintainability
- **Enhanced Data Models**: Comprehensive data structures for all features
- **Real-time Interactions**: Dynamic UI updates and modal systems
- **Advanced Features**: Project evaluation, advisory services, Q&A platform
